The frog is safe in the grass.
The frog will die and lose a life if it is hit by a car on the road.
The frog will die and lose a life if it enters the water.
The frog will be carried on a log if most of the frog is on the log.
The frog will be carried on a turtle if most of the frog is on the turtle and the turtle is mostly above water.
The frog will die and lose a life if most of the frog is on the turtle and the turtle is mostly under water.
The frog will die and lose a life if it is carried offscreen on a log or turtle.
If there are less than 3 lives and the frog lands on the fly, one life will be added.
The frog must jump on top of an unoccupied lily pad in a hedge to be safe. 
All lily pads must be occupied by a safe frog to move on to the next level.
There are 7 levels in total.
